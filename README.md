# ESP32S3_SDR_Guition
ESP32S3 SDR radio with a resistive touch screen from Guition and SSB, AM and FM demodulation
Got inspiration from Cvarc-Xtal project published on https://github.com/Cvarc-Xtal/ESP32-SDR-TRX
He made a very good basis project for the development of SDR transceiver using ESP32 I2S capabilities and addad comrehencive graphics which is popular in SDR radios.
I have modified code and added some new functionality and to imroove the AM demodulation while also added FM demodulation.
My goal was to make full functional receiver with minimal hardware involvement.
